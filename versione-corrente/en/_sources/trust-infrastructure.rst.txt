The Infrastructure of Trust
===========================

The IT-Wallet ecosystem operates within a federated trust infrastructure where participating entities establish cryptographic trust relationships and maintain compliance with common security standards. This infrastructure provides the foundation for secure Digital Credential operations across the ecosystem participants.

This section defines the implementation of the Trust Model in an infrastructure that complies with eIDAS ARF and OpenID Federation 1.0 `OID-FED`_. OpenID Federation operates at the national level and is complemented by Member State Trusted Lists for QEAA and EAA Providers, as detailed in :ref:`trust-infrastructure:national-provider-trusted-lists-implementation-profile`. The List of Trusted Lists (LoTL) maintained by the European Commission, in the role of eIDAS Trusted List provider, aggregates pointers to all published eIDAS Trusted Lists, enabling cross-border trust establishment and centralized discovery of Trusted List locations and signing keys.

The national infrastructure involves a RESTful API for distributing metadata, metadata policies, trust marks, cryptographic public keys and X.509 Certificates, and the revocation status of the participants, also called Federation Entities.

This trust infrastructure works in coordination with the Registry Infrastructure (see :ref:`registry:Registry Infrastructure`) to enable the entity onboarding processes detailed in :ref:`entity-onboarding:Entity Onboarding`. In particular, it enables the technical   implementation of the onboarding processes described in :ref:`entity-onboarding:Entity Onboarding` and supports the operational scenarios illustrated in :ref:`onboarding-high-level:Onboarding Journey Maps`.

The Trust Infrastructure provides the cryptographic mechanisms that allow new entities (Credential Issuers, Relying Parties, Wallet Providers) to establish verifiable trust relationships during their registration process. Without this infrastructure, entities would not be able to prove their compliance status or operational capabilities to other ecosystem participants.

Throughout an entity's operational lifecycle, the Trust Infrastructure maintains up-to-date trust attestations, handles key rotation, manages revocation scenarios, and supports compliance monitoring. This directly supports the lifecycle management procedures detailed in :ref:`entity-onboarding:Entity Onboarding`.

In this representation, both the :term:`National Trust Anchor` and the Intermediates assume the role of Registration Authority.

Federation Roles
----------------

All the participants are Federation Entities that MUST be registered by a Registration Body, except for Wallet Instances which are End-User's personal devices authenticated by their Wallet Provider.

.. note::
  The Wallet Instance, as a personal device, is deemed reliable through a verifiable attestation issued and signed by a trusted third party.

  This is called *Wallet Attestation* and is documented in the dedicated :ref:`wallet-attestation-issuance:Wallet App and Wallet Unit Attestation Issuance`.

**Role in Onboarding**: Entity onboarding is split between **Registration Authorities (Registrars)** and **Federation Authorities** (Trust Anchor and Intermediates). Registrars handle **administrative registration** (legal identity, regulatory compliance, business justification, and eligibility), while Federation Authorities handle **federation registration** (issuing federation certificates, applying federation metadata policies, and placing entities in the trust hierarchy). Leaves (Credential Issuers, Relying Parties, Wallet Providers) undergo both steps: they first prove their eligibility to the Registrar and then obtain federation authorization from the Federation Authorities to perform their designated functions in Credential operations.

**Role in Operations**: During Credential issuance and presentation, these roles enable distributed trust validation without requiring centralized verification for each transaction. Leaves utilize their registered status to issue Credentials, verify presentations, or provide Wallet services to end users.

Below the table with the summary of the Federation Entity roles, mapped on the corresponding EUDI Wallet roles.

Trust Infrastructure and Registry Integration
---------------------------------------------

The Trust Infrastructure implements the Federation Registry component of the Registry Infrastructure. The Federation Registry maintains the authoritative list of trusted entities through the federation endpoints defined in this section, including entity listing (/list), subordinate statements (/fetch), trust mark validation (/trust_mark_status), subordinate events (/federation_subordinate_events_endpoint), and historical key management (/historical-jwks).

This Federation Registry operates alongside other registry components (Claims Registry, AS Registry, Digital Credentials Catalog, Taxonomy) to provide comprehensive ecosystem support. For complete registry architecture and component interactions, see :ref:`registry:Registry Infrastructure`.

.. _trust-infrastructure:national-provider-trusted-lists-implementation-profile:

Trust Infrastructure Schema: Onboarding and Trusted Lists
---------------------------------------------------------

The trust infrastructure relies on five distinct but complementary processes:

1. **Registration/Onboarding**: Entities (PID Providers, Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers, Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers, Relying Parties, Wallet Providers) register with the National Registrar or the IT-Wallet onboarding system to define operational authorization and entitlements.
2. **Notification**: The Member State notifies the European Commission, as operator of the EU-level eIDAS Trusted List Provider, of **PID Providers**, **PuB-EAA Providers**, **Wallet Providers**, **Access Certificate Authorities (Access CAs)**, and **Providers of Registration Certificates** for inclusion in the relevant Trusted Lists.
3. **National Catalog and List Publication**: Publication of national catalogs and lists for registered entities via RESTful endpoints.
4. **eIDAS Trusted List Publication**: Publication of EU-level eIDAS Trusted Lists by the European Commission, based on notifications from the Member State for Wallet Providers, PID Providers, PuB-EAA Providers, Access CAs, and Registration Certificate Providers.
5. **National Trusted List Publication**: Publication of national Trusted Lists for QEAA Providers and non-qualified EAA Providers by the Member State Trusted List Provider (MS TLP), based on National Registrar data.

National Provider Trusted Lists: Implementation Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section provides the implementation profile for national Trusted Lists compiled and published by the Member State Trusted List Provider (MS TLP) for both Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAA) Providers and non-qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA) Providers, as required by the EUDI Wallet trust infrastructure.

Regulatory Requirements and Motivations
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The requirements for EAA Provider Trusted Lists are established by the eIDAS trust services framework and ETSI technical standards:

- **`ETSI TS 119 612`_**: XML-based Trusted Service Lists (TSL) format for Trusted Lists, including service type definitions and status management. This profile continues to be used for **QTSP Trusted Lists**, including **QEAA Providers**.
- **`ETSI TS 119 602`_** and **Annex H**: Abstract data model and profile for Lists of Trusted Entities (LoTE), including **Attestation Provider Trusted Lists for non-qualified EAA Providers and, where applicable, Pub‑EAA Providers**. QEAA Providers remain in QTSP Trusted Lists under `ETSI TS 119 612`_, while Annex H is used for national EAA Provider Trusted Lists with JSON and XML bindings.

Implementation Profile for QEAA Provider Trusted Lists
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

QEAA Providers are Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs). After successful registration with the National Registrar, QEAA Providers are included in Member State QTSP Trusted Lists compiled and published by the Member State Trusted List Provider (MS TLP) in XML format compliant with `ETSI TS 119 612`_ and signed with XAdES Baseline B as per `ETSI EN 319 132-1`_.


Below is a non-normative example of a QEAA Provider entry in a Member State QTSP Trusted List, following the `ETSI TS 119 612`_ XML format (payload only, without XAdES signature):

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/qeaa-provider-trusted-list-example.xml
   :language: xml
   :caption: Non-normative example of a QEAA Provider entry in a Member State QTSP Trusted List (XML format, `ETSI TS 119 612`_ payload only, without signature)

Implementation Profile for Non-Qualified EAA Provider Trusted Lists
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Non-qualified EAA Providers are included in national EAA Provider Trusted Lists, which represent national extensions complementing the QTSP Trusted Lists. These Trusted Lists are compiled and published by the Member State Trusted List Provider (MS TLP), which also submits their URLs to the European Commission for inclusion in the List of Trusted Lists (LoTL). National EAA Provider Trusted Lists may use the `ETSI TS 119 602`_ Annex H profile for Attestation Provider Trusted Lists, published either in JSON format with compact JAdES Baseline B signatures or in XML format with XAdES Baseline B signatures as per `ETSI EN 319 132-1`_, with enveloped XML signatures when XML is used. In all cases, Trust Lists in JSON format MUST be signed using compact JAdES Baseline B signatures as mandated by `ETSI TS 119 182-1`_, and Trust Lists in XML format MUST be signed using XAdES Baseline B signatures as mandated by `ETSI EN 319 132-1`_, to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of the Trusted List content.

ETSI requirements for EAA Provider Trusted Lists
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
`ETSI TS 119 602`_ Annex H defines the requirements for non-qualified EAA Provider TLs, 
summarized as follows:

- **LoTE Type**: Appropriate URI for Attestation Provider Trusted Lists
- **Service Types**: 
  - Issuance service type URI
  - Revocation service type URI (if applicable)
- **Service Status**: ServiceStatus component MUST be present for Pub-EAA Providers; for non-qualified EAA Providers, status management follows Member State policy
- **Status Starting Time**: StatusStartingTime component MUST be present when ServiceStatus is used
- **Historical Information**: HistoricalInformationPeriod MUST be present with appropriate value when service history is maintained
- **Next Update**: Maximum 6 months between updates
- **Signature**: Compact JAdES Baseline B (JSON) or XAdES Baseline B (XML) - **MANDATORY** as per ETSI requirements

Below is a non-normative example of a non-qualified EAA Provider Trusted List payload (without signature) following the `ETSI TS 119 602`_ Annex H profile in JSON format. The example shows only the Trusted List payload without the JAdES signature. In production, Trust Lists MUST be signed using compact JAdES Baseline B signatures as per `ETSI TS 119 182-1`_.

   :language: json
   :caption: Non-normative example of a non-qualified EAA Provider Trusted List payload (JSON format, `ETSI TS 119 602`_ Annex H profile, payload only, without signature)

**`ETSI TS 119 612`_ Requirements** (for QTSP TLs including QEAA Providers):

- **TSL Type**: `http://uri.etsi.org/TrstSvc/TrustedList/TSLType/EUgeneric` or appropriate Member State TSL type
- **Service Type Identifiers**: Appropriate service type URIs for QEAA services
- **Service Status**: Standard eIDAS service status values
- **Signature**: XAdES Baseline B (enveloped signature format) as mandatory per ETSI requirements

List of Trusted Lists (LoTL) Integration
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Per `ETSI TS 119 612`_ clause D.5, the European Commission maintains a List of Trusted Lists (LoTL) that:

- Contains pointers (TrustedListPointers) to all published Trusted Lists
- Each pointer includes the Trusted List location (TSLLocation), scheme territory, and scheme operator name
- Facilitates cross-border trust establishment
- Centralizes trusted list distribution
- Supports federation-level service discovery

The European Commission:

- Compiles the LoTL from:
  - The directly compiled and published Trusted Lists (Wallet Provider TL, PID Provider TL, Access CA TL, Registration Cert Provider TL)
  - Trusted List URL notifications received from Member State TLPs (for qualified and non-qualified EAA Providers)
- Signs/seals the LoTL using the Commission's signing key
- Publishes the LoTL in machine-readable and human-readable formats
- Publishes LoTL location and trust anchors in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)

Federation API endpoints
------------------------

OpenID Federation 1.0 uses RESTful Web Services secured over HTTPs. OpenID Federation 1.0 defines which are the web endpoints that the participants MUST make publicly available. The table below summarises the endpoints and their scopes.

All the endpoints listed below are defined in the `OID-FED`_ specs.

.. list-table::
   :class: longtable
   :widths: 20 20 20 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - endpoint name
     - http request
     - scope
     - required for
   * - federation metadata
     - **GET** .well-known/openid-federation
     - Metadata that an Entity publishes about itself, verifiable with a trusted third party (Superior Entity). It's called Entity Configuration.
     - Trust Anchor, Intermediate, Wallet Provider, Relying Party, Credential Issuer
   * - subordinate list endpoint
     - **GET** /list
     - Lists the Subordinates. See `OID-FED`_ Section 5.1.1
     - Trust Anchor, Intermediate
   * - fetch endpoint
     - **GET** /fetch?sub=https://rp.example.org
     - Returns a signed JWT about a specific subject, its Subordinate. It's called Subordinate Statement. See `OID-FED`_ Section 5.1.1
     - Trust Anchor, Intermediate
   * - trust mark status
     - **POST** /status?sub=...&trust_mark_id=...
     - Returns the status of the issuance (validity) of a Trust Mark related to a specific subject. See `OID-FED`_ Section 5.1.1
     - Trust Anchor, Intermediate
   * - trust marked listing
     - **GET** /trust_mark_listing?trust_mark_id=...
     - Lists all entities for which Trust Marks have been issued and are still valid. See `OID-FED`_ Section 5.1.1
     - Trust Anchor, Intermediate
   * - historical keys
     - **GET** /historical-jwks
     - Lists the expired and revoked keys, with the motivation of the revocation. See `OID-FED`_ Section 5.1.1
     - Trust Anchor, Intermediate
   * - subordinate events
     - **GET** /federation_subordinate_events_endpoint?sub=https://rp.example.org
     - Returns a historical track of registration events about Immediate Subordinates, such as registration, revocation, and updates of their Federation Entity Keys. See the section :ref:`trust-infrastructure:Federation Subordinate Events Endpoint` for more details.
     - Trust Anchor, Intermediate


All the responses of the federation endpoints are in the form of signed JWT, with the exception of the Subordinate Listing endpoint and the Trust Mark Status endpoint that are served as plain JSON by default. The Federation Subordinate Events Endpoint also returns signed JWTs with the content type ``application/entity-events-statement+jwt``.

National Trusted List endpoints
-------------------------------

In addition to the OpenID Federation endpoints, the IT-Wallet ecosystem exposes HTTPS distribution points for eIDAS Trusted Lists and national EAA Provider Trusted Lists. These endpoints are operated by the Member State Trusted List Provider (MS TLP) and publish the authoritative, signed Trusted Lists that are referenced by the LoTL and consumed by Wallet Units, Credential Issuers, and Relying Parties.

- QTSP Trusted List for QEAA Providers MUST be published by the :term:`National Trust Anchor` as XML TSL documents compliant with `ETSI TS 119 612`_, at HTTPS distribution points under the National Trust Anchor FQDN (for example, ``https://<NationalTrustAnchorFQDN>/tsl/qeaa-tsl.xml``), and signed with XAdES Baseline B according to `ETSI EN 319 132-1`_.
- National EAA Provider Trusted List (for non-qualified EAA Providers and, where applicable, Pub-EAA Providers) MUST be published as LoTE documents following `ETSI TS 119 602`_ Annex H, at HTTPS distribution points under the National Trust Anchor FQDN (for example, ``https://<NationalTrustAnchorFQDN>/lote/eaa-providers.json``), in JSON (preferred) or XML, and signed with compact JAdES Baseline B or XAdES Baseline B as mandated by `ETSI TS 119 182-1`_ and `ETSI EN 319 132-1`_.

Clients belonging from EUDI Wallet ecosystem consume these endpoints by periodically downloading the lists, validating the digital signatures, and applying the service status and sequence number semantics defined in `ETSI TS 119 612`_ and `ETSI TS 119 602`_ to build and refresh their local trust stores.

Configuration of the Federation
-------------------------------

The configuration of the federation is published by the Trust Anchor within its Entity Configuration, it is available at the well-known web path corresponding to **.well-known/openid-federation**.

All the participants in the federation MUST obtain the federation configuration before entering the operational phase, and they MUST keep it up-to-date. The federation configuration is the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration, it contains the public keys for signature operations.

Below is a non-normative example of a Trust Anchor Entity Configuration, where each parameter is documented in the `OpenID Federation <OID-FED>`_ specification:

Entity Configuration
--------------------

The Entity Configuration is the verifiable document that each Federation Entity MUST publish on its own behalf, in the **.well-known/openid-federation** endpoint.

The Entity Configuration HTTP Response MUST set the media type to `application/entity-statement+jwt`.

The Entity Configuration MUST be cryptographically signed. The public part of this key MUST be provided in the Entity Configuration and within the Subordinate Statement issued by a immediate superior and related to its subordinate Federation Entity.

The Entity Configuration MAY also contain one or more Trust Marks.

**Role in Onboarding**: New entities publish their Entity Configuration as part of their registration process, declaring their capabilities, supported protocols, and compliance status to the federation. The configuration serves as the entity's initial declaration of its technical readiness and operational scope, enabling other participants to discover and validate its registration status.

**Role in Operations**: During Credential operations, Entity Configurations are retrieved by wallets, credential issuers, and relying parties to verify the current operational status, supported capabilities, and compliance attestations of other entities. This enables dynamic discovery of service endpoints, cryptographic keys, and protocol versions required for secure Credential exchange.

Technical details about Entity Configuration of Wallet Provider, Credential Issuer and Relying Party are given in Section :ref:`wallet-provider-entity-configuration:Wallet Provider Entity Configuration`, :ref:`credential-issuer-entity-configuration:Credential Issuer Entity Configuration` and :ref:`relying-party-entity-configuration:Relying Party Entity Configuration` respectively.

.. note::
  **Entity Configuration Signature**

  All the signature-check operations regarding the Entity Configurations, Subordinate Statements and Trust Marks, are carried out with the Federation public keys. For the supported algorithms refer to Section `Cryptografic Algorithm`.

  In instances where a PID/EAA Provider implements both the Credential Issuer and the Authorization Server, it MUST incorporate both ``oauth_authorization_server`` and ``openid_credential_issuer`` within its metadata types.
  Other implementations may divide the Credential Issuer from the Authorization Server, when this happens the Credential Issuer metadata MUST contain the `authorization_servers` parameters, including the Authorization Server unique identifier.
  Furthermore, should there be a necessity for User Authentication by the Credential Issuer, it could be necessary to include the relevant metadata type, either ``openid_relying_party`` or ``openid_credential_verifier``.


Metadata of federation_entity Leaves
------------------------------------

The *federation_entity* metadata for Leaves MUST contain the following claims.

Subordinate Statements
----------------------

Trust Anchors and Intermediates publish Subordinate Statements related to their immediate Subordinates.
The Subordinate Statement MAY contain a metadata policy and the Trust Marks related to a Subordinate.

The metadata policy, when applied, makes one or more changes to the final metadata of the Leaf. The final metadata of a Leaf is derived from the Trust Chain that contains all the statements, starting from the Entity Configuration up to the Subordinate Statement issued by the Trust Anchor.

Trust Anchors and Intermediates MUST expose the Federation Fetch endpoint, where the Subordinate Statements are requested to validate the Leaf's Entity Configuration signature.

.. note::
  The Federation Fetch endpoint MAY also publish X.509 Certificates for each of the public keys of the Subordinate. Making the distribution of the issued X.509 Certificates via a RESTful service.

**Role in Onboarding**: During entity registration, Trust Anchors and Intermediates issue Subordinate Statements to formally attest the registration and capabilities of new entities. These statements establish the hierarchical trust relationship and apply any required metadata policies that constrain or enhance the entity's declared capabilities based on federation policies.

**Role in Operations**: During Credential operations, Subordinate Statements are retrieved to validate Trust Chains and apply current metadata policies. They enable real-time verification of an entity's registration status and ensure that operational capabilities comply with federation-wide policies and the entity's authorized scope.

Below there is a non-normative example of an Subordinate Statement issued by an Registration Body (such as the Trust Anchor or its Intermediate) in relation to one of its Subordinates.

Federation Discovery
----------------------------------

Federation Entity Discovery is the process by which participants verify the identity and status of other federation entities. This involves querying federation endpoints to confirm entity validity status and compliance with the Trust Framework.

The discovery process uses the Federation API to collect entity information and produces Trust Chains that validate entity compliance and authorization within the federation.

The discovery process establishes the foundational concepts that are then applied in specific operational scenarios as detailed in the Trust Evaluation Mechanism section.

.. note::
  Trust Anchors MUST distribute their Federation Public Keys through secure out-of-band mechanisms, such as publishing them on a verified web page or storing them in a remote repository as part of a trust list. The rationale behind this requirement is that relying solely on the data provided within the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration does not adequately mitigate risks associated with DNS and TLS manipulation attacks. To ensure security, all participants MUST obtain the Trust Anchor's public keys using these out-of-band methods. They should then compare these keys with those obtained from the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration, discarding any keys that do not match. This process helps to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the Trust Anchor's public keys and the overall security of the federation (:ref:`WP_017 <wallet-instance-testcases>`).

Each Subordinate Statement is verifiable over time and MUST have an expiration date. The revocation of each statement is verifiable in real time and online (only for remote flows) through the federation endpoints.

.. note::
  The revocation of an Entity is made with the unavailability of the Subordinate Statement related to it. If the Trust Anchor or its Intermediate doesn't publish a valid Subordinate Statement, or if it publishes an expired/invalid Subordinate Statement, the subject of the Subordinate Statement MUST be intended as not valid or revoked.

The concatenation of the statements, through the combination of these signing mechanisms and the binding of claims and public keys, forms the Trust Chain.

The Trust Chains can also be verified offline, using one of the Trust Anchor's public keys.

.. note::
  Since the Wallet Instance is not a Federation Entity, the Trust Evaluation Mechanism related to it **requires the presentation of the Wallet Attestation during the credential issuance and presentation phases**.

  The Wallet Attestation conveys all the required information pertaining to the instance, such as its public key and any other technical or administrative information, without any User's personal data.

Trust Chain
-----------

The Trust Chain is a sequence of verified statements that validates a participant's compliance with the Federation. It has an expiration date time, beyond which it MUST be renewed to obtain the fresh and updated metadata. The expiration date of the Trust Chain is determined by the earliest expiration timestamp among all the expiration timestamp contained in the statements. No Entity can force the expiration date of the Trust Chain to be higher than the one configured by the Trust Anchor.

**Role in Onboarding**: During the entity onboarding, Trust Chains are constructed to prove the complete hierarchical trust relationship from the Trust Anchor to the new entity.

**Role in Operations**: During Credential issuance and presentation, Trust Chains provide cryptographic proof of entity validity and compliance status. 

Below is an abstract representation of a Trust Chain.

    ]


.. note::
  The entire Trust Chain is verifiable by only possessing the Trust Anchor's public keys.

There are events where keys are unavailable to verify the entire trust chain:

 - **Key Change by Credential Issuer**: The Credential Issuer MAY update its cryptographic keys. The cryptographic keys MUST be considered valid if evaluated within their originally designated validity period unless a security reason makes them unusable. The revocation reason MUST be published. Historical cryptographic keys, i.e. unused or revoked public cryptographic keys, MUST be published using the Federation Historical Keys Endpoint.

 - **Change in Credential Types**: If the Credential Issuer changes the Credential **types** issued, for instance deciding not to issue anymore one or more Credential types, the related public cryptographic keys MUST be available for the originally designated validity period.

 - **Credential Issuers Merge**: If a Credential Issuer merges with another, creating a new Organizational Entity or working on behalf of another one using a different hostname or domain, the **previously** available federation configuration and historical keys MUST be kept available at the original Credential Issuer's well-known endpoints.

 - **Credential Issuer Becomes Inactive**: If a Credential Issuer becomes inactive, its **related** Entity Configuration and Federation Historical Entity Endpoint MUST be kept available.

Offline Trust Attestation Mechanisms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The offline flows do not allow for real-time evaluation of an Entity's status, such as its revocation. At the same time, using short-lived Trust Chains enables the attainment of trust attestations compatible with the required revocation administrative protocols (e.g., a revocation must be propagated in less than 24 hours, thus the Trust Chain must not be valid for more than that period).


Offline Wallet Trust Attestation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Given that the Wallet Instance cannot publish its metadata online at the *.well-known/openid-federation* endpoint, it MUST obtain a Wallet Attestation issued by its Wallet Provider. The Wallet Attestation MUST contain all the relevant information regarding the security capabilities of the Wallet Instance and its protocol related configuration. It SHOULD contain the Trust Chain related to its issuer (Wallet Provider).


Offline Relying Party Metadata
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Since the Federation Entity Discovery is only applicable in online scenarios, it is possible to include the Trust Chain in the presentation requests that the Relying Party may issue for a Wallet Instance.

The Relying Party MUST sign the presentation request, the request SHOULD include the `trust_chain` claim in its JWT header parameters, containing the Federation Trust Chain related to itself.

The Wallet Instance that verifies the request issued by the Relying Party MUST use the Trust Anchor's public keys to validate the entire Trust Chain related to the Relying Party before attesting its reliability.

Furthermore, the Wallet Instance applies the metadata policy, if any.

Trust Chain Fast Renewal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Trust Chain fast renewal method offers a streamlined way to maintain the validity of a trust chain without undergoing the full discovery process again. It's particularly useful for quickly updating Trust Relationships when minor changes occur or when the Trust Chain is close to expiration but the overall structure of the federation hasn't changed significantly.

The Trust Chain fast renewal process is initiated by fetching the leaf's Entity Configuration anew. However, unlike the federation discovery process that may involve fetching Entity Configurations starting from the authority hints, the fast renewal focuses on directly obtaining the Subordinate Statements. These statements are requested using the `source_endpoint` provided within them, which points to the location where the statements can be fetched.


Trust Evaluation Mechanism
--------------------------

Trust Anchors MUST distribute their Federation Public Keys through secure out-of-band mechanisms, such as publishing them on a verified web page or storing them in a remote repository as part of a trust list. The rationale behind this requirement is that relying solely on the data provided within the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration does not adequately mitigate risks associated with DNS and TLS manipulation attacks. To ensure security, all participants MUST obtain the Trust Anchor's public keys using these out-of-band methods. They should then compare these keys with those obtained from the Trust Anchor's Entity Configuration, discarding any keys that do not match. This process helps to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the Trust Anchor's public keys and the overall security of the federation.

The Trust Anchor publishes the list of its Subordinates (Federation Subordinate Listing endpoint), the attestations of their metadata and public keys (Subordinate Statements), and historical events related to their lifecycle (Federation Subordinate Events endpoint).

Each participant, including Trust Anchor, Intermediate, Credential Issuer, Wallet Provider, and Relying Party, publishes its own metadata and public keys (Entity Configuration endpoint) in the well-known web resource **.well-known/openid-federation**.

Each of these can be verified using the Subordinate Statement issued by a superior, such as the Trust Anchor or an Intermediate.

Each Subordinate Statement is verifiable over time and MUST have an expiration date. The revocation of each statement is verifiable in real time and online (only for remote flows) through the federation endpoints.

.. note::
  The revocation of an Entity is made with the unavailability of the Subordinate Statement related to it. If the Trust Anchor or its Intermediate doesn't publish a valid Subordinate Statement, or if it publishes an expired/invalid Subordinate Statement, the subject of the Subordinate Statement MUST be intended as not valid or revoked.

The concatenation of the statements, through the combination of these signing mechanisms and the binding of claims and public keys, forms the Trust Chain.

The Trust Chains can also be verified offline, using one of the Trust Anchor's public keys.

.. note::
  Since the Wallet Instance is not a Federation Entity, the Trust Evaluation Mechanism related to it **requires the presentation of the Wallet Attestation during the credential issuance and presentation phases**.

  The Wallet Attestation conveys all the required information pertaining to the instance, such as its public key and any other technical or administrative information, without any User's personal data.

**Role in Onboarding**: Trust evaluation mechanisms are essential during entity registration and lifecycle management to verify the compliance status of new participants and validate changes to existing entities. This includes validating the registration credentials of entities requesting onboarding and ensuring they meet federation policies before granting operational authorization.

**Role in Operations**: During credential issuance and presentation operations, trust evaluation provides real-time verification of entity validity and compliance status. This enables secure credential transactions by ensuring that all participating entities (credential issuers, relying parties, wallet providers) maintain their authorized status and comply with current federation policies.


Establishing Trust with Credential Issuers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the issuance process, Trust Evaluation ensures the integrity and authenticity of the Credentials being issued and the realiability of their Issuers. This section delineates the Trust Evaluation mechanisms distinct from the protocol flows, implemented by Wallet Instances and Relying Parties, as described in the dedicated section.

Trust Evaluations implement different ways, as defined below:

* **Federation Entity Discovery**: Wallet Instances and Relying Parties MUST verify the identity of the Issuer using the Federation Entity Discovery process defined in :ref:`trust-infrastructure:Federation Discovery`. This involves querying federation endpoints to confirm the Issuer's validity status and compliance with the Trust Framework. Historical event data from the Federation Subordinate Events Endpoint can provide additional context about the entity's lifecycle and compliance history.

* **Trust Chains**: Wallet Instances and Relying Parties evaluate Issuer's Trust Chains using the mechanisms defined in :ref:`trust-infrastructure:Trust Chain`. Trust Chains may be provided statically or built through a Federation Entity Discovery process, to ensure that the entity requesting the Credential is part of a recognized and trusted federation.

* **Trust Marks Evaluation**: Trust Marks are assessed to ensure ongoing compliance with federation policies. These marks indicate adherence to specific standards and practices required by the federation.

* **Policy Evaluation**: Wallet Instances and Relying Parties MUST check that the Credential Issuer is allowed in the issuance of the Credential of their interest. Metadata, metadata policies and Trust Marks are used for the implementation of these checks (:ref:`WP_050a <wallet-credential-issuance-testcases>`).

In the process represented in the sequence diagram below, the Wallet Instance uses the Federation API to discover and collect all the Credential Issuers enabled within the federation. The discovery process produces the Trust Chain. When the Trust Chain is provided statically within a signed request or Credential, it only REQUIRES to be refreshed when the internet connection is available, while it MUST be refreshed when the statically provided Trust Chain results as expired.

.. note::
  As shown in the figure, the Trust Evaluation process is entirely separate and distinct from the protocol-specific flow. It operates in a different flow and utilizes specialized protocols designed specifically for this purpose.

Establishing Trust with Relying Party
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the context of evaluating Relying Parties, the responsibility for Trust Evaluation lies solely with the Wallet Instance.
The Trust Evaluation mechanisms are distinct from protocol flows and are implemented by the Wallet Instance, as detailed in the dedicated section.

Trust Evaluations are conducted as follows:

* **Federation Entity Discovery**: When the Wallet Instance receives a signed request issued by a Relying Party, the Wallet Instance MUST verify the identity of the Relying Party using the Federation Entity Discovery process defined in :ref:`trust-infrastructure:Federation Discovery`. This involves querying federation endpoints to confirm the Relying Party's validity status and compliance with the Trust Framework and evaluating the request signature using the cryptographic material obtained from the Trust Chain. Historical event data from the Federation Subordinate Events Endpoint can provide additional context about the Relying Party's lifecycle and compliance history.

* **Trust Chains**: The Wallet Instance evaluates the Relying Party's Trust Chains using the mechanisms defined in :ref:`trust-infrastructure:Trust Chain`. Trust Chains may be provided statically or built through a Federation Entity Discovery process, to ensure that the Relying Party is part of a recognized and trusted federation. This involves checking the Trust Chain from the root authority (Trust Anchor) to the Relying Party (:ref:`WP_079 <wallet-credential-presentation-testcases>`).

* **Trust Marks Evaluation**: Trust Marks are assessed to ensure ongoing compliance with federation policies. These marks indicate adherence to specific standards and practices required by the federation. Relying Parties MAY include Trust Marks in their Entity Configuration to signal administrative properties and compliance to specific profiles, such as the grants in interacting with under-age users (:ref:`WP_080 <wallet-credential-presentation-testcases>`).

* **Policy Evaluation**: The Wallet Instance MUST verify that the Relying Party is authorized to request the Credential of interest. Metadata, metadata policies, and Trust Marks are used to implement these checks (:ref:`WP_087 <wallet-credential-presentation-testcases>`).

In the process depicted in the sequence diagram below, the Wallet Instance uses the Federation API to discover and collect all the Relying Parties enabled within the federation. The discovery process produces the Trust Chain. When the Trust Chain is provided statically within a signed request, it only needs to be refreshed when an internet connection is available, but it MUST be refreshed if the statically provided Trust Chain is expired.

.. note::
  As shown in the figure, internet connection is required to update the Trust Chain about an RP and check its revocation status.

Evaluating Trust with Wallets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Wallet Provider issues the Wallet Attestation, certifying the operational status of its Wallet Instances and including one of their public keys.

The Wallet Attestation MAY contain the Trust Chain that attests the reliability for its issuer (Wallet Provider) at the time of issuance.

The Wallet Instance provides its Wallet Attestation within the signed request during the PID issuance phase. The Credential Issuer MUST evaluate the Trust Chain about the Wallet Attestation issuer (formally, the Wallet Provider).

Non-repudiability of the Long Lived Attestations
------------------------------------------------

The Trust Anchor and its Intermediate MUST expose the Federation Historical Keys endpoint, where are published all the public part of the Federation Entity Keys that are no longer used, whether expired or revoked.

The details of this endpoint are defined in the `OID-FED`_ Section 8.7.

Each JWT containing a Trust Chain in the JWT headers can be verified over time, since the entire Trust Chain is verifiable using the Trust Anchor's public key.

Even if the Trust Anchor has changed its cryptographic keys for digital signature, the Federation Historical Keys endpoint always makes the keys no longer used available for historical signature verifications.

X.509 PKI
---------

The X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework designed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital X.509 Certificates. At the heart of X.509 PKI is the concept of a Certificate Authority (CA), which issues digital certificates to entities. These certificates are required for establishing secure communications over networks, including the internet, by enabling encryption and digital signature functionalities. The PKI hierarchy typically involves a root CA at the top, with one or more subordinate CAs beneath, forming a trusted chain. Entities rely on this chain of trust to verify the authenticity of certificates. X.509 standards define the format of public key certificates.

The integration of OpenID Federation 1.0 with the traditional X.509 based PKI (rfc:5280), complemented by a RESTful API, aims to enhance the infrastructure with additional features, making it navigable and transparent.

This approach leverages the dynamic and flexible nature of OpenID Federation alongside the requirement of the X.509 Certificates for legacy applications and interoperability purposes, aiming to addresses the evolving needs of verification of the registration status of the federation participants, their compliance to the shared rules and the general and interoperable trust management in multilateral digital ecosystems.

**Role in Onboarding**: During entity registration, X.509 Certificates complement OpenID Federation mechanisms by providing interoperability with legacy systems and enabling integration with existing PKI infrastructures.

**Role in Operations**: During Credential operations, X.509 Certificates enable secure communications with legacy systems and provide alternative verification paths for entities that require traditional PKI validation. 

OpenID Federation and X.509 based PKI share several things in common, as listed below:

- **Hierarchical Approach**: both utilize a hierarchical Trust Model with a single, overarching trusted third party, known as the Trust Anchor, which is trusted above all others.
- **Scalability with Multiple Trust Anchors and Intermediates**: despite a unique hierarchical model, the possibility of having multiple Trust Anchors and Intermediates, below one or more Trust Anchors, scales the responsibilities.
- **Custom Extensions**: both systems allow for custom extensions to meet specific requirements or to enhance functionality. X.509 Certificates support custom extensions, OpenID Federation allows definition of custom protocol specific metadata, Trust Marks and policies using a Policy Language.
- **Trust/Certificate Chain**: they rely on a chained proof of trust, where trust is passed down from the root authority (Trust Anchor) through Intermediaries to the end entity (Leaf).
- **Constraints in the Chain**: constraints can be applied within the Trust Chain regarding critical aspects such as the delegation of trust, the number of intermediaries, and the domains involved.
- **Public Key Distribution**: Both systems involve the distribution of the public key of the Trust Anchor to ensure entities can verify the trust chain.
- **Registry of Expired Keys**: Maintaining a registry of expired keys is crucial for both, ensuring non-repudiation of past signatures even when keys change.


Federation Trust Anchor and X.509 CA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the context of OpenID Federation, the Trust Anchor plays a role similar to that of a Certificate Authority (CA) in X.509-based Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs). Both serve as foundational elements of trust within their respective systems. In this document, the term "Trust Anchor" is often used to encompass both concepts. The trust infrastructure described here aligns the OpenID Federation Trust Anchor with the X.509 PKI Certificate Authority, making therefore them a single unique entity supporting both `RFC 5280`_ and OpenID Federation 1.0.

X.509 Certificates Issuance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In an OpenID Federation, each participant is required to self-issue its Entity Configuration, signing it with one of its cryptographic keys that are attested by Immediate Superiors.

In the same way, each federation Entity has the autonomy to issue a signed statement about itself in the form of a X.509 Certificate.
Federation participants that need to issue X.509 Certificates about themselves and for their specific purposes, can issue and sign X.509 Certificates using one of their Federation Entity Keys attested by their Federation Authorities (Immediate Superior). This process aligns the issuance of X.509 Certificates with the federation's delegation paradigm.

This is feasible because the X.509 Certificate can be verified using a X.509 Certificate Chain, similar to the approach used for Entity Configurations in OpenID Federation.

Federation Leaves are not Certificate Authorities (CAs) or CA intermediaries authorized to issue X.509 Certificates for their subordinates. Instead, Federation Leaves act as intermediaries for issuing certificates solely about themselves. This is accomplished by applying appropriate naming constraints to ensure that X.509 Certificates are correctly scoped.
Naming constraints are applied by Immediate Superiors within the certificates issued to the Leaf entity, specifically concerning the Leaf's Federation Entity Keys. As a result, the Leaf can only issue X.509 Certificates about itself, thereby maintaining the integrity of the Trust Chain.

When a participant self-issues an X.509 Certificate, it adheres to the following requirements:

1. **Subject Name**: The X.509 Certificate's subject name MUST match the participant's identity. The subject name for Intermediaries and Leaves MUST include the following attributes:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 30 70
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Attribute
        - Requirement
      * - ``Country Name (C)``
        - MUST contain the two-letter ISO country code.
      * - ``State or Province Name (ST)``
        - MUST contain the region or state where the entity is located.
      * - ``Locality Name (L)``
        - MUST contain the city where the entity is located.
      * - ``Organization Name (O)``
        - MUST contain the legal name of the organization.
      * - ``Organizational Unit Name (OU)``
        - MAY contain the department name within the organization (optional).
      * - ``Common Name (CN)``
        - MUST contain the Federation Entity unique identifier DNS name, which is included in the ``sub`` (subject) value in its federation Entity Configuration, removing ``https://`` and any webpaths.
      * - ``Email Address``
        - MUST contain the organization's contact email address.
      * - ``organizationIdentifier``
        - MUST contain the registration number that uniquely identifies the organization within the registration service, using the OID value ``2.5.4.97`` as defined in ``ITU-T X.500``.
        
2. **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)**: The X.509 Certificate MUST include a ``SAN URI`` that MUST match the **sub** and the **iss** values of its federation Entity Configuration.
3. **DNS Name**: The X.509 Certificate MUST include a DNS Name in the SAN that matches the DNS name contained within the **sub** and the **iss** values of its Entity Configuration, removing ``https://`` and any webpaths.
4. **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**: If the issued X.509 Certificates has an expiration time superior to 24 hours, the X.509 Issuer MUST publish a CRL for the issued X.509 Certificates. This list MUST be accessible and regularly updated to ensure that any compromised or invalid X.509 Certificates are promptly revoked with the motivation of the revocation, if any.
5. **Basic Constraints**: The X.509 Certificate MUST include a ``Basic Constraints`` extension with ``CA:TRUE`` and a maximum path length of 1 if the certificate issuer is a Federation Intermediate. If it is a Leaf, the maximum path length MUST be set to 0. This indicates that the Subordinate to which certificate is about, can only issue X.509 Certificates about itself. ``BasicConstraints`` extension MUST be set ``critical``.
6. **Key Usage**: ``Digital Signature``, ``Key Encipherment``, ``Certificate Sign``, ``CRL Sign`` MUST be included. ``KeyUsage`` extension MUST be set ``critical``.
7. **Name Constraints**: The X.509 Certificate MUST include ``Name Constraints`` to specify permitted and excluded domains and URIs. For instance:

   - Permitted:
     - ``URI.1=https://leaf.example.com``
     - ``DNS.1=leaf.example.com``
   - Excluded:
     - ``DNS=localhost``
     - ``DNS=localhost.localdomain``
     - ``DNS=127.0.0.1``
     - ``DNS=example.com``
     - ``DNS=example.org``
     - ``DNS=example.net``
     - ``DNS=*.example.org``

8. **AuthorityKeyIdentifier**: The X.509 Certificate MUST include an ``AuthorityKeyIdentifier`` extension. The ``keyIdentifier`` field of the ``AuthorityKeyIdentifier`` extension MUST be present and MUST be identical to the ``SubjectKeyIdentifier`` field of the issuer's certificate. This consolidates the certificate chain building and validation.

Below is a non-normative example, in plain text (OpenSSL format), of an X.509 certificate chain with an intermediate CA, starting from the Leaf certificate.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/x5c.json
  :language: text

Using the underlying layer established with OpenID Federation 1.0, all X.509 Certificates are issued in a properly decentralized manner using the delegation pattern.


X.509 Certificate Revocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An X.509 Certificate can be revoked by its Issuer.
Revocation lists, and/or any other revocation control mechanism, are particularly required for X.509 Certificates with an expiration time greater than 24 hours; otherwise, they are not required.

When the issuer of the X.509 Certificate is the Leaf and therefore the X.509 Certificate refers to itself, if the certificate expiration time is greater than 24 hours from the ``X509_NOT_VALID_BEFORE`` time, it MUST implement a CRL related to the issued certificate and keep it updated.
When the issuer of the X.509 Certificate is an immediate Superior, such as the Trust Anchor or an Intermediary, and revokes the certificate related to the Leaf, i.e., the X.509 Certificate related to one of the Federation Entity Keys of the Leaf, this action invalidates the entire Trust Chain associated with that cryptographic public key of the Leaf, effectively removing its ability to issue further X.509 Certificates about itself. This hierarchical revocation mechanism ensures that any compromise or misbehavior by a Leaf entity can be quickly addressed.

Below is a non-normative example, in plain text, illustrating the content of a CRL.

Federation Subordinate Events Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Federation Subordinate Events Endpoint is defined in `OID-FED-SUBORDINATE-EVENTS`_. This endpoint provides a mechanism for Trust Anchors and Intermediates to publish historical events related to their Immediate Subordinates registration status. It provides transparency and accountability within the federation by providing a comprehensive historical record of significant events affecting federation participants.

For complete specification details, including endpoint location, request format, response format, JWT claims, event object parameters, and supported event types, refer to `OID-FED-SUBORDINATE-EVENTS`_.

Below is a non-normative example of a Federation Subordinate Events Endpoint request and response:

**Example Request**:

.. code-block:: http

   GET /federation_subordinate_events_endpoint?sub=https%3A%2F%2Frp%2Eexample%2Eorg HTTP/1.1
   Host: immediate-superior.example.org

**Example Response**:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "iss": "https://immediate-superior.example.org",
     "sub": "https://rp.example.org",
     "iat": 1590000000,
     "federation_registration_events": [
       {
         "iat": 1590000000,
         "event": "registration"
       },
       {
         "iat": 1590000000,
         "event": "jwks_update"
       },
       {
         "iat": 1600000000,
         "event": "revocation",
         "event_description": "compromised node"
       },
       {
         "iat": 1610000000,
         "event": "registration"
       }
     ]
   }

**Integration with Entity Lifecycle Management**:

This endpoint complements the entity lifecycle management procedures defined in :ref:`entity-onboarding:Entity Onboarding` by providing detailed historical tracking of all significant events affecting federation participants. It supports both automated compliance monitoring and manual auditing processes.

Privacy Remarks
---------------

- Wallet Instances MUST NOT publish their metadata through an online service.
- The trust infrastructure MUST be public, with all endpoints publicly accessible without any client credentials that may disclose who is requesting access.
- When a Wallet Instance requests the Subordinate Statements to build the Trust Chain for a specific Relying Party or validates a Trust Mark online, issued for a specific Relying Party, the Trust Anchor or its Intermediate do not know that a particular Wallet Instance is inquiring about a specific Relying Party; instead, they only serve the statements related to that Relying Party as a public resource.
- The Wallet Instance metadata MUST not contain information that may disclose technical information about the hardware used.
- Leaf entity, Intermediate, and Trust Anchor metadata may include the necessary amount of data as part of administrative, technical, and security contact information. It is generally not recommended to use personal contact details in such cases. From a legal perspective, the publication of such information is needed for operational support concerning technical and security matters and the GDPR regulation.


Considerations about Decentralization
-------------------------------------

- There may be more than a single Trust Anchor.
- In some cases, a trust verifier may trust an Intermediate, especially when the Intermediate acts as a Trust Anchor within a specific perimeter, such as cases where the Leafs are both in the same perimeter like a Member State jurisdiction (eg: an Italian Relying Party with an Italian Wallet Instance may consider the Italian Intermediate as a Trust Anchor for the scopes of their interactions).
- Trust attestations (Trust Chain) should be included in the JWT issued by Credential Issuers, and the Presentation Requests of RPs should contain the Trust Chain related to them (issuers of the presentation requests).
- Since the credential presentation must be signed, storing the signed presentation requests and responses, which include the Trust Chain, the Wallet Instance may have the snapshot of the federation configuration (Trust Anchor Entity Configuration in the Trust Chain) and the verifiable reliability of the Relying Party it has interacted with.
- Each signed attestation is long-lived since it can be cryptographically validated even when the federation configuration changes or the keys of its issuers are renewed.
- Each participant should be able to update its Entity Configuration without notifying the changes to any third party. The metadata policy contained within a Trust Chain must be applied to overload any information related to protocol specific metadata.
