.. important::
  If ``token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`` includes ``attest_jwt_client_auth``, the Authorization Server MUST include both
  ``client_attestation_signing_alg_values_supported`` and ``client_attestation_pop_signing_alg_values_supported`` in its metadata.
  Clients SHOULD fetch and parse the Authorization Server metadata to detect support and algorithm requirements for Attestation-Based Client Authentication. When algorithms are incompatible, the client MAY obtain a new client attestation using a supported algorithm.
