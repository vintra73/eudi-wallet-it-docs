Wallet Provider Endpoints
-------------------------

The Wallet Provider, responsible for delivering a Wallet Solution, MUST expose the endpoints to support trust establishment and essential Wallet Instance functionalities. These include the ``/.well-known/openid-federation`` Federation Endpoint which MUST adhere to the OpenID Federation 1.0 specification to reliably establish trust with the Wallet Provider's as well as, endpoints for Wallet Instance registration, nonce generation (required for registration), attestation issuance, and revocation. Aside from the Federation endpoint, the implementation details of the others are left to the Wallet Provider's discretion.

.. note::
  Tests related to the use of Wallet Provider endpoints are defined in 
  :ref:`wallet-provider-test-matrix`, particularly 
  :ref:`wallet-provider-backend-testcases`,
  :ref:`wallet-instance-testcases`, and 
  :ref:`wallet-instance-optional-testcases`.

Federation Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``/.well-known/openid-federation`` endpoint serves as the discovery mechanism for trust establishment by retrieving the Wallet Provider Entity Configuration.

See Section :ref:`wallet-provider-entity-configuration:Wallet Provider Entity Configuration` for technical details (:ref:`WP_001–004 <wallet-provider-backend-testcases>`).


Wallet Solution Nonce Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a RESTful API endpoint that allows the Wallet Instance to request a cryptographic nonce from the Wallet Provider. The nonce serves as an unpredictable, single-use challenge to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.

See :ref:`mobile-application-instance:Mobile Application Nonce Request` and :ref:`mobile-application-instance:Mobile Application Nonce Response` for details on the Nonce Request and Nonce Response (:ref:`WP_131 <wallet-instance-optional-testcases>`).

Wallet Instance Management Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are RESTful API endpoints provided by the Wallet Provider that enables Wallet Instance management, including registration, status retrieval, revocation upon request (e.g., by the User), and deletion.
The following sections describe the registration, status retrieval and revocation requests, along with their corresponding responses, handled by this endpoint, which are required for core :ref:`wallet-instance-functionalities:Wallet Instance Functionalities`.

Wallet Instance Registration Request
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To register a Wallet Instance, the request to the Wallet Provider MUST use the HTTP POST method with ``Content-Type`` set to `application/json`. The request body MUST contain the claims described in :ref:`mobile-application-instance:Mobile Application Instance Initialization Request` (:ref:`WP_131–134 <wallet-instance-optional-testcases>`).

Wallet Instance Registration Response
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If a Wallet Instance Registration Request is successfully validated, the Wallet Provider provides an HTTP Response with status code 204 (No Content). For detatails see :ref:`mobile-application-instance:Mobile Application Instance Initialization Response` (:ref:`WP_135–137 <wallet-instance-optional-testcases>`).

Wallet Instance Retrieval Request
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To retrieve all Wallet Instances associated with a User, a request MUST be sent using the HTTP GET method to the Wallet Provider (:ref:`WP_145 <wallet-instance-optional-testcases>`).

.. note::
  For retrieving a specific Wallet Instance, the request MUST include the Wallet Instance ID as a path parameter.


Wallet Instance Retrieval Response
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If a Wallet Instance Retrieval Request is successfully processed, the Wallet Provider MUST return an HTTP Response with a 200 (OK) status code.
The response body MUST be in JSON format and include the relevant Wallet Instance information, such as its unique ID, status, and issuance date.
When retrieving all Wallet Instances, the response MUST return an array containing the details of all associated instances (:ref:`WP_146 <wallet-instance-optional-testcases>`).

If any errors occur during the retrieval process, an error response MUST be returned. Refer to :ref:`wallet-provider-endpoint:Error Handling for Wallet Instance Management` for details on error codes and descriptions.

Below is a non-normative example of an error response:

.. code-block:: http

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error": "forbidden",
     "error_description": "User is not authorized to retrieve Wallet Instances."
   }


Wallet Instance Revocation Request
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To revoke an active Wallet Instance, a revocation request MUST be sent using the HTTP PATCH method with Content-Type set to ``application/json``. The request body MUST contain a ``status`` parameter set to ``REVOKED`` (:ref:`WP_147 <wallet-instance-optional-testcases>`).

.. note::
  While PATCH is the recommended method, the revocation request MAY also be sent using the POST method, depending on implementation preferences.

Wallet Instance Revocation Response
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If a Wallet Instance Revocation Request is successfully processed, the Wallet Provider provides an HTTP Response with a 204 (No Content) status code (:ref:`WP_148 <wallet-instance-optional-testcases>`).

If any errors occur during the Wallet Instance Revocation, an error response MUST be returned. Refer to :ref:`wallet-provider-endpoint:Error Handling for Wallet Instance Management` for details on error codes and descriptions (:ref:`WP_035–039, WP_043–044 <wallet-instance-testcases>`).

Below is a non-normative example of an error response:

.. code-block:: http

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error": "bad_request",
     "error_description": "The request is missing status parameter."
   }

Error Handling for Wallet Instance Management
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To ensure robustness and security, the Wallet Provider MUST handle errors consistently across all Wallet Instance Management requests, including Registration, Retrieval, and Revocation.

In case of an error, the Wallet Provider MUST return an error response as defined in :rfc:`7231`, with additional details available in :rfc:`7807`. The response MUST use the Content-Type set to ``application/json`` and MUST include the following parameters:

- *error*. The error code.
- *error_description*. Text in human-readable form providing further details to clarify the nature of the error encountered.
 
The following sections categorize errors into **common errors**, which apply to all requests, and **request-specific errors**, which are relevant to particular operations (:ref:`WP_035–044 <wallet-instance-testcases>`, and :ref:`WP_150–155 <wallet-instance-optional-testcases>`).

Common Error Responses

      - `OpenID4VCI`_.
    * - **user_authentication**
      - REQUIRED. A non-empty array of case sensitive strings that assert the attack potential resistance of the user authentication methods allowed to access the private keys from the ``attested_keys`` parameter. The following values are defined as a value for this claim:

        - ``iso_18045_high``: It MUST be used when user authentication is resistant to attack with attack potential ``High``.
        - ``iso_18045_moderate``: It MUST be used when user authentication is resistant to attack with attack potential ``Moderate``.
        - ``iso_18045_basic``: It MUST be used when user authentication is resistant to attack with attack potential ``Basic``.
      - `OpenID4VCI`_.
    * - **status**
      - REQUIRED. JSON Object representing the supported revocation check mechanisms, such as OAuth Status List.
      - `OpenID4VCI`_.
    * - **eudi_wallet_info**
      - REQUIRED. JSON object, containing the general information about the Wallet and Wallet Provider. The following parameters MUST be included:

        - **general_info**: REQUIRED. An object that has the following parameters:

          - **wallet_provider_name**: REQUIRED. String value of the Wallet Provider name as listed on the trusted list of Wallet Providers.
          - **wallet_solution_id**: REQUIRED. String value of the Wallet Solution identifier as listed on the trusted list of Wallet Providers. 
          - **wallet_solution_version**: REQUIRED. String value of the Wallet Solution version.
          - **wallet_solution_certification_information**: REQUIRED. String that contains a URL that links to the certification of the Wallet Solution.

        - **key_storage_info**: REQUIRED. An object that has the following parameters:

          - **storage_type**: REQUIRED. String value that identifies the technical implementation of WSCD. It can have one of the following values, ``REMOTE``, ``LOCAL_EXTERNAL``, ``LOCAL_INTERNAL``, ``LOCAL_NATIVE``, or ``HYBRID``. 
          - **keys_exportable**: REQUIRED. Boolean value that defines whether the private keys of the WSCD or keystore can be exported. It SHALL be set to ``true`` if the WSCD  allows the private keys to be exported (including if in encrypted format only) and ``false`` otherwise.
          - **storage_certification_information**: REQUIRED. String that contains a URL that links to the certification of the key storage component. 
      - `EUDI-TS 3`_.


Below is a non-normative example of the Wallet Unit Attestation JWT header and payload, without encoding and signature applied:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/wua-jwt_example_header.json
  :language: JSON

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/wua-jwt_example_payload.json
  :language: JSON


.. note::
    As the certification scheme has not yet been defined, the exact content of ``wallet_solution_certification_information`` is undefined. 
    This content will be defined in a future update. Similarly, the exact content of ``storage_certification_information`` is currently undefined and will be specified in a future update, but it SHALL provide sufficient information to determine whether the key storage is a WSCD.  
    Note that the OID4VCI specification does specify a ``certification`` attribute in the ``key_attestation`` element that could be used instead of ``storage_certification_information``.
